# Generating Image Variations with DALL-E using OpenAI's API

1. Make sure that you have set up your keys correctly with the exercise `01-OpenAI-Key.md` from Lesson 01

2. Make sure that your `venv` is activated

3. Run the following code on your terminal:

   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

   - This command will install the `openai` [API Package](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) on your environment

4. Create a new Python file

   - Create a new file on your favorite code editor or simply run `touch <filename>.py` on your terminal (Linux/MacOS) or `type nul > <filename>.py` on your terminal (Windows)
     - Remember to replace `<filename>` with the name of your file

5. Import the `openai` module on your file

   ```python
   from openai import OpenAI
   ```

   - This `client` can abstract all of the complexities of consuming the OpenAI API endpoints, like handling the authentication, the request and response formats, synchronous and asynchronous requests, and many other features

   - To use this library correctly, all you need to do is to understand well the [API parameters](https://platform.openai.com/docs) that you want to consume

6. Create a new `client` instance

   ```python
   client = OpenAI()
   ```

   - By default, this will try to use the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to create this client

   - You can customize the logic by doing an explicit definition like this:

     ```python
     import os
     from openai import OpenAI

     client = OpenAI(
         api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
     )
     ```

     - Here you can change `api_key` to any value that you want to use

     - Have caution if you prefer to hardcode your key in this file, since this could lead to you inadvertently sharing your key with others

7. Call the [Image Variation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images/variations-dall-e-2-only) endpoint in the `client` with the following parameters:

   ```python
   response = client.images.create_variation(
     image=open("Coconut.png", "rb"),
     n=1,
     size="1024x1024"
   )
   ```

8. Print the URL of the generated image

   ```python
   print(f"Variation: {response.data[0].url}")
   ```

9. Execute the Python script

   > Make sure to run the script from the same directory where the `Coconut.png` image is located. You can use `cd` to navigate to the correct directory

   ```bash
   # Linux/MacOS
   python <filename>.py
   ```

   ```bash
   # Windows
   py <filename>.py
   ```

10. Check the output

    - You should see the URL of the generated image printed on your terminal

    - Copy the URL and paste it into your browser to view the generated image

11. Extend the script to call the [Edit Image](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images/edits-dall-e-2-only) endpoint in the `client` with the following parameters:

    ```python
    response = client.images.edit(
      model="dall-e-2",
      image=open("Coconut.png", "rb"),
      mask=open("Mask.png", "rb"),
      prompt="A football ball in the beach",
      n=1,
      size="1024x1024"
    )
    ```

12. Print the URL of the generated image

    ```python
    print(f"Edit: {response.data[0].url}")
    ```

13. Execute the Python script again

    > Make sure to run the script from the same directory where the `Coconut.png` and `Mask.png` images are located. You can use `cd` to navigate to the correct directory

    ```bash
    # Linux/MacOS
    python <filename>.py
    ```

    ```bash
    # Windows
    py <filename>.py
    ```

14. Check the edited output

    - You should see the URL of the edited image printed on your terminal

    - Copy the URL and paste it into your browser to view the edited image
