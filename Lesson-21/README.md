## Generating Images with Stable Diffusion

- Overview of Stable Diffusion

  - **Stable diffusion**: A type of **generative model** using a **diffusion process** to generate images
    - **Generative model**: Machine learning models that create new data similar to training data
    - **Diffusion**: Process of gradually adding noise to data and learning to reverse it
  - Core concept: Iteratively apply transformations to a **random noise vector** to produce a coherent image
    - **Noise vector**: Randomly initialized values serving as the starting point
    - **Transformations**: Mathematical operations shaping the noise into an image
  - Each step moves the noise vector closer to resembling a realistic image

- Running a Diffusion Model

  - Process: Iteratively apply transformations to a random noise vector
  - Goal: Produce a coherent image
  - Method: Select transformations that guide the noise vector towards resembling a realistic image
  - Termination: Predetermined number of steps or when output meets quality criteria

- How it Works

  - Stable diffusion employs two main steps: **forward diffusion** and **reverse diffusion**

  1. Forward Diffusion (Noising Process)
     - Begins with an image, gradually adds **Gaussian noise** over steps until it becomes pure noise
     - Modeled as a **Markov chain**: Each step depends only on the previous one
     - Utilizes conditional Gaussian distributions
     - Transforms data distribution into a **tractable distribution** (e.g., isotropic Gaussian)
       - **Tractable distribution**: Easy to sample from and compute probabilities
       - **Isotropic Gaussian**: Multivariate normal distribution with independent variables and uniform variance
  2. Reverse Diffusion (Backward Denoising)
     - Reverses the noising process, converting noise back into an image
     - Employs a **neural network** to predict and subtract added noise at each step
     - Network is conditioned on factors such as current noise level and possibly text embeddings
       - **Embedding**: Dense vector representation of discrete data in continuous space
     - Iterative process: Begins from pure noise, gradually reduces noise to reconstruct an image
     - Output: Sample resembling a natural image or corresponding to text description

- Training the Model

  - Optimizes a **loss function**: Measures difference between predicted and actual added noise
  - **Loss function**: Guides optimization of model parameters

- Image Generation
  - Initiates from random Gaussian noise image
  - Iteratively denoises using learned reverse diffusion process
