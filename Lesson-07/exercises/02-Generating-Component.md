1. Log in to [Vercel V0](https://v0.dev/)
2. Create a starting UI from this prompt: `A simple leaderboard page with the most requested dishes in a restaurant`
3. Make iterative changes until you have a page with a table listing some dishes and the number of requests for each
4. Change the appearance of the table and the elements by clicking on them and writing a specific prompt, like: `Make the first column bold` or `make the first row with a golden background`
5. Make a prompt to add a new button navigate to the `Request a Dish` page
6. Make all the changes that you see fir until you have a complete page that you feel that you can use in your project
7. Click the "Code" button in the top right and copy the CLI command like `npx v0@latest add [id]`
8. Navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal and paste the copied terminal command
9. If needed, configure `shadcn-ui` in your project with the command `npx shadcn-ui@latest init`
10. Now you can create a new page in your project and import the generated component to use in that page
11. Test the new page in your project and make any adjustments needed
